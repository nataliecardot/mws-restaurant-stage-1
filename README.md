# Restaurant Reviews App

## Project Overview

I completed this project as part of Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program.

Using starter code for a restaurant reviews webpage, I fulfilled a few requirements, including:
1. Optimized the design to be responsive at multiple screen sizes (I used Flexbox and CSS Grid)
2. Implemented accessibility features
3. Cached requests to the site's assets for offline use using the [Service Worker API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API)

## How to Run

View it live [here](https://nataliecardot.com/mws-restaurant-stage-1/)

**View locally:**

1. Clone the project and unzip the file.
2. From the project directory, open the command terminal. (In Windows you can simply type `cmd` in the search bar and hit enter.)
3. Use Python to launch a local client server. You need Python installed, and which version you have installed determines what command to enter. It often comes installed on your computer. You can check the version you have (if any) by entering `python -v` in the terminal. If needed, download it from Python's [website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and complete installation.
* Python 2: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
* Python 3: `python3 -m http.server 8000`. Leave the terminal open.
4. Visit the site in your browser at http://localhost:8000

## Dependencies
